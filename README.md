# Deep-Learning-Bank-Marketing-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing bank marketing data using deep learning techniques. The dataset contains various features related to customer demographics, financial information, and marketing interactions. The goal is to build a predictive model using an Artificial Neural Network  to predict a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not.

* Project Overview *  
This project utilizes Python and TensorFlow to perform bank marketing analysis. The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, visualized, and used to train an ANN model. The trained model is evaluated using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics.

* Installation *  
Install the required Python libraries, or import the required libraries in your environment.

* Usage *
Download the Bank Marketing Dataset and save it in the project directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script

* Data Preprocessing *
Data is loaded from the CSV file and cleaned by handling missing values and outliers.
Categorical variables are encoded using Label Encoder.
Features are scaled or normalized for model training.

* Data Visualization *
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset.
Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create visualizations that help understand feature distributions, correlations, etc.

* Model Training *
An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is constructed using TensorFlow.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
The model is trained using the training data and validated using the testing data.

* Evaluation Metrics *
The trained model's performance is evaluated using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Lower values of MSE and MAE indicate better model performance.

* Contributing *
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues and pull requests.
